# Screens in the 70s
Welcome to Screens in the 70s, Scott Richmond's Winter 2019 graduate seminar at the University of Toronto.

This is a repository for course documents, including:

* [The syllabus](syllabus.md), which contains most of what you'd ordinarily expect.
* [The Covenant for the seminar](covenant.md), which details (in exorbitantly explicit detail) what seminar members agree to.
* [Class patterns](class-patterns.md), which details how we will spend our time during our seminar meetings.
* [On questions and discussion](questions-and-discussion.md), which offers Scott's guidance on how to ask good questions and how to have a good discussion.

You probably also want a link to our Slack team. Stay tuned.
