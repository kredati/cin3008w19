## Course information
### Description
This course investigates three distinct but conceptually intersecting fields of discourse and screen practice as they underwent various kinds of upheaval in the "long 1970s" (ca. 1968–1984): cinema, video art, and computation. In the cinema, we find not only the formalization of conceptual thinking about the cinematic system in apparatus theory, we also see the invention of a new business model—the blockbuster—that intensively capitalizes and financializes spectators' attention. At the same time, we see video's transition, in Yvonne Spielman's terms, from technology to medium. In the early 1970s, video emerges as a newfound resource for investigating the body's relationship to technology and time, all while cutting a path through the apparent impasses of high modernism. As for computation, we see the co-emergence of computation as a personal medium and its innovation as a screen-based, graphic medium. In each of these, technical systems and their reflection in contemporaenous conceptual discourse seem to bring into focus one or several crises in relations to technical media, especially in their capacity to articulate structures of subjectivity (or, in a different idiom, genres of personhood).

We might condense or redact these crises by pointing to the 1970s as a deeply transitional moment in culture, aesthetics, and political economy. In short, the 1970s lies at the hinge between modernism and postmodernism (in an aesthetic idiom), or the postwar boom and neoliberalism (in a political–economic one). One of the tasks of the course will be to establish ways of thinking about each medium's relationship to these larger transformations. In short, the thesis of this course is that each of these kinds of screens, taken separately _and_ together, offer important resources for understanding the history of the present and of the structures of subjectivity under which we now live.

To be sure, the 1970s encompasses _vastly_ more phenomena than this course is able to include, not least of which were important historical shifts in feminist, gay rights, and Black liberation movements. It saw the high-water mark of film pornography, the invention of home video, "Hollywood Renaissance" auteurism, and Blaxpoloitation. And Vietnam, Watergate, post-68 disappointment, and the rise of a resurgent Right. And that's just in the United States. The project of the course will _not_ be to offer an overview of these movements, nor even to situate them globally. Students' are encouraged to pursue research projects that take on any of these, or their own paritcular interests. The course aims to provide a context in which we might begin to see how shifts and experiments in how we attune ourselves to media systems refracts larger shifts in the US, in North America, in the Anglo-American world, and in global arrangements of capitalism.

Students will write a substantial research (seminar) paper. A major focus of this course is methodological, and it will include multiple research and writing workshops.
