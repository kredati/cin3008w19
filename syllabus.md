## Course information
### Description
This course investigates three distinct but conceptually intersecting fields of discourse and screen practice as they underwent various kinds of upheaval in the "long 1970s" (ca. 1968â€“1984): cinema, video art, and computation. In the cinema, we find not only the formalization of conceptual thinking about the cinematic system in apparatus theory, we also see the invention of a new business modelâ€”the blockbusterâ€”that intensively capitalizes and financializes spectators' attention. At the same time, we see video's transition, in Yvonne Spielman's terms, from technology to medium. In the early 1970s, video emerges as a newfound resource for investigating the body's relationship to technology and time, all while cutting a path through the apparent impasses of high modernism. As for computation, we see the co-emergence of computation as a personal medium and its innovation as a screen-based, graphic medium. In each of these, technical systems and their reflection in contemporaenous conceptual discourse seem to bring into focus one or several crises in relations to technical media, especially in their capacity to articulate structures of subjectivity (or, stated in a different idiom, genres of personhood).

We might condense or redact these crises by pointing to the 1970s as a deeply transitional moment in culture, aesthetics, and political economy. In short, the 1970s lies at the hinge between modernism and postmodernism (in an aesthetic idiom), or the postâ€“WWII industrial boom and neoliberalism (in a politicalâ€“economic one). One of the tasks of the course will be to establish ways of thinking about each medium's relationship to these larger transformations. In short, the thesis of this course is that each of these kinds of screens, taken separately _and_ together, and at this particular moment in time, offer important resources for understanding the history of the present and of the structures of subjectivity under which we now live.

To be sure, the 1970s encompasses _vastly_ more phenomena than the core of this course is able to include, not least of which were important historical shifts in feminist, gay rights, and Black liberation movements. The 70s saw the high-water mark of film pornography, the invention of home video, "Hollywood Renaissance" auteurism, and Blaxpoloitation. And Vietnam, Watergate, post-68 disappointment, and the rise of a resurgent Right. And that's just in the United States. (Your professor is a provincial American.) The project of the course will _not_ be to offer an overview of these movements and developments, nor to situate them globally. Students will be (very) encouraged to pursue research projects that take on any of these, or their own paritcular interests, in relation to the broad problems of the course. The course aims to provide the historical, conceptual, and methodological context in which we might invstigate the shifts and experiments in how we attune ourselves to media systems, and how those refract larger shifts in the US, in Canada, in North America, in the Anglo-American world, and in the persisting global arrangements of capitalism.

Students will write a substantial research (seminar) paper. A major focus of this course is methodological, and class time will include multiple research and writing workshops.

### Course goals
The most important goal for this course is to give students the means and opportunity to pose, motivate, and answer significant research questions, in variously historical and theoretical modes of inquiry, about screen-based media in the long 1970s (see above).

Secondary course goals include: real development in students' ability to pose good research questions; substantial increase in content knowledge of the cinema, video art, and history of computation of the 1970s; comfort working at the intersection of conceptual and historical knowledge; and training in comparative media methods.

### Coursework
**PhD students** will produce a "seminar paper," which means a scholarly piece of writing of the approximate size and shape of a journal article. It should: be approximately 7,000 words (give or take 10%; including notes & references; this is approximately 20-25 manuscript pages); conform to the 17th edition of the [_Chicago Manual of Style_](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/home.html) guidelines for citation and manuscript preparation; pose, motivate, and answer a significant research question; be clearly and stylishly written; and proceed according to the conceptual or historical methods and idioms you most wish to develop in your research trajectory.

**MA students** will produce either a seminar paper (as above), or a curatorial, creative, or research creation project that represents approximately the same amount of work, and the same level of conceptual and methodological brio.

In either case, the research process will involve extensive reading and research beyond the required course readings.

### Marks & marking
Two thirds of your final mark will be determined by your final paper or project. The remaining third of your final mark will be determined by a holistic assessment of your classroom participation, including your presence in the classroom, the quantity and quality of your contributions to discussion, your good-faith participation in the term writing workshop (the post-term writing workshop is voluntary), and the success of your role as guides.

## Course values and processes
The most important activity we will pursue together in this course is the posing of questions. Asking good questions means, of necessity, leading with what you _don't_ know. Which makes it, in the context of institutional and pedagogical cultures of competence, a very vulnerable thing. The various rituals, covenants, and processes of this course are designed to cultivate an atmosphere where students can lean into their vulnerability.

In other words, from the get go, we will be getting vulnerable togetherâ€”but in structured ways that will (Scott hopes) alleviate some of the anxiety that attends vulnerability. For further reading on this see our Course Covenant and the Structures of Class. (Stay tuned for these.)

### Guides
Most every class will have one or two guides (the exceptions are noted in the [Course Schedule](#course-schedule), below). They will open the class with two (possibly three) genuine questions, to which the rest of the class will apply themselves. They will offer an account of the motivations for these questions. The procedures for this are spelled out in the Structures of Class document. See also the Questions and Discussions documents. (Stay tuned for these.)

## Course technology
* **Course website:** https://github.com/kredati/cin3008w19/. This website (ðŸ‘‹) contains all open (not-access controlled) material: Scott's notes, this syllabus, course documents regarding process, questions, and discussion, etc.
* **Slack team:** In place of Canvas, we will use Slack as our main communication and collaboration tool. Any access-controlled material will live on Slack (readings, anything student-produced). We will sign up for accounts during our first meeting (or in advance of it). (Stay tuned.)
* **Canvas:** We will mostly not use Canvas.

## Course materials
Most readings will be made available (methods depending on fair use) at least one week in advance of when they are due.

Students should purchase a copy of Wayne Booth, et al., _The Craft of Research_, Fourth Edition (2016). It is available at [Amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/Craft-Research-Fourth-Wayne-Booth/dp/022623973X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1546472047&sr=8-1&keywords=the+craft+of+research). It should arrive not later than mid-February. (If you already own an older edition of this, you do need not purchase a new one; however, if you are buying your first copy, please do get the Fourth edition.)

### Course bibliography
Scott will maintain a (fairly deep) bibliography of materials (books, articles, etc.) related to the course. These will be both primary and secondary. This is not a list of things you need to master, but rather suggestions for further reading. This will be a living document; Scott will add to it over the course of the semester, and will enthusiastically add your recommendations to the list.

## Course policies and procedures
### Email & other communication
Scott cannot guarantee a response to electronic communication (email, a Slack DM) in a particular time frame, but you can generally expect a response within two business days. (Some exceptions apply, as during SCMS in March.) Please clearly mark any time-sensitive matters in the subject heading. Please also feel _very_ encouraged to send reminder emails after a decent amount of time has elapsed (somewhere between two days and a week, depending). Scott will thank you enthusiastically for these reminders.

### Submission and "publication" of work
We are a community of scholars working together on related projects. The normative method of submitting work will be uploading it to the course Slack in a public channel. This means that, normally, other students will see your workâ€”the process-based work over the course of the term and your final projects. You may at any point opt out of such submission & publication methods, but you must coordinate this with Scott.

### On deadlines & late work
You have deadlines because Scott has deadlines. The deadline for the final project is set to give you as much time as possible to do excellent work on a seminar paper, which is the most important determinant of your final mark. Extensions beyond this deadline are possible, but Scott has limited ability to offer such extensions, so ask early. In all cases, extensions must be negotiated **well in advance of the deadline**, and not less than two business days before it. Late work that has not been negotiated in advance of the deadline **will not be accepted**. Note also that Scott's ability to offer extensions is itself limited; at a certain date, the bureaucracy of the School of Graduate Studies takes over handling of extensions. Please do what you can to avoid the necessity of Scott's learning this particular set of bureaucratic procedures.

### Academic dishonesty
This may seem remedial in a graduate course, but indulge Scott for a brief moment. In a nutshell, academic dishonesty means representing another's work as your own. Direct quotation of passages requires quotation marks and citation; paraphrases require citation. If you didn't come up with the idea itself, attribute it. Scott's work is littered with footnotes that read "I learned to think about x this way from Another Scholar..." Citation is an ethical and political practice of community building and an expression of solidarity. Take it very seriously. Scott does.

Any instances of academic dishonesty will be handled according to the School of Graduate Studies's [Policies and Procedures on Academic Integrity](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/facultyandstaff/Pages/Academic-Integrity.aspx). That is important bureaucracy to master; please do so.

One final note, grounded in Scott's many years of experience: the embarrassment of asking whether something constitutes academic dishonestyâ€”or, more likely, asking for help if you feel like you're drowningâ€”is rather less bad than the humiliation and very real consequences of a plagiarism case. In the former instance, you're the only one with a feeling, and the outcome looks like Scott teaching you something or offering an extension. In the latter instance, everybody has real bad feelings, and the outcomes of plagiarism cases aren't pleasant.
